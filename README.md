# LINE-Bot
Asynchronous messaging bot made for the LINE messaging app

## How to run the bot

This guide assumes you already have your bot set up. If you have not set up your bot on the LINE developer portal then use [this guide](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot/).

Make sure you have entered your `CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

Now you can start the bot!
```py
# On MacOS/Linux:
python3 launcher.py

# On Windows:
py launcher.py
```
